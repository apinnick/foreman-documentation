= Using boot disks to provision hosts

Some hardware does not provide a PXE boot interface or your environment may not support network boot.
In {Project}, you can provision a host without PXE boot.
This is also known as PXE-less provisioning and involves generating a boot ISO that hosts can use.
Using this ISO, the host can boot the installation media, connect to {SmartProxy}, and install the operating system.

{Project} also provides a PXE-less discovery service that operates without PXE-based services, such as DHCP and TFTP.

THIS IS THE NEW LINK.
For more information, see xref:common/modules/con_discovery-in-pxeless-mode.adoc#discovery-in-pxeless-mode[Discovery in PXE-less mode].
